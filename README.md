# My Link Database

This project is meant to be my personal link database, where I can save any number of interesting links with
categorization and a little description. I also want to make it searchable via AI later. Similarily to 
https://links.stoerr.net/ it should get some kind of browsability.

## Command line scripts

There are two scripts in the `bin/` directory:
- linkadd: adds an url : it is summarized with ChatGPT, and creates a file about it that is opened in intellij.
- linksearch: llm based search for links

## View links

To be done.
