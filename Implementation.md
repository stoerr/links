**# Implementation

This project is meant to be my personal link database, where I can save any number of interesting links with
categorization and a little description. I also want to make it searchable via AI later. Similarily to
https://til.stoerr.net/ it should get some kind of browsability.

## Basic idea

The links should just be saved into the file system, no actual database that'd need a server. We will put every link
into it's individual file that defines URL, title, description and category. The path contains the date, e.g.
`2024/02-11/My-Link-Title.md`.

## Creating a link

We make a script bin/addLink that takes the URL as argument, creates a new file in the current date's directory, and
opens the file in the editor. The file will contain a template for the link, which the user can fill in.

## Presentation and search

Local search can be done using [llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm).

## Link files

The link files are markdown files with a frontmatter that contains the URL, title, category and date.
The rest of the file is the description and summary of the link. The files are saved in a directory structure
that is based on the date of the link: e.g. 2024/02-11/My-Link-Title.md.
Example link file:

```
---
filename: TheArtOfCoding
category: AI, Coding
url: https://foo.bar/baz
title: The Art of Coding
description: An exploration into coding
---

# The Art of Coding

https://foo.bar/baz

## Description

An exploration into coding

## Summary

The article describes much stuff about coding.
```

## JSON

We collect the links into a big JSON file `db/links.json` that contains an array of links:

```json
[
  {
    "filepath": "2024/02-11/wizardzine.md",
    "category": [
      "productivity",
      "development"
    ],
    "url": "https",
    "text": "# Wizard Zines\n\nhttps://wizardzines.com/comics/ \n\nAn entertaining set of tipps for programmers - with a surprising amount of useful\nnice little stuff you might not have heard about even as a seasoned SoftwareEngineer ."
  },
  ...
]
```

The script bin/makeLinkJson.js creates this file. The files should be sorted alphabetically by filename - this way
they are sorted by date and there is a deterministic order. It should use no additional libraries that aren't in
nodejs anyway.

We put this into .git/hooks/pre-commit to make sure the file is always up to date.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
node bin/makeLinkJson.js
git add db/links.json
```

Also a db/embeddings.json is created the same way that contains the OpenAI text-embedding-3-large embeddings of the
texts:

```json
  {
  "id": "2024/02-11/wizardzine.md",
  "embedding": {
    "$base64": true,
    "encoded": "3zxwu9e...sVjz929s7"
  },
  "content": "---\nfilename: wizardzine.md\ncategory: productivity, development\nurl: https://wizardzines.com/comics/\n---\n\n# Wizard Zines\n\nhttps://wizardzines.com/comics/ \n\nAn entertaining set of tipps for programmers - with a surprising amount of useful\nnice little stuff you might not have heard about even as a seasoned SoftwareEngineer .\n"
},
...
```

## Web interface

https://links.stoerr.net/ implements a search from the browser (index.md). That loads both db/links.json and
db/embeddings.json into the browser. Since both files are large, the fetched data has to be stored in a local variable. 
On search, it uses the OpenAI embeddings API to get the embeddings of the search
and compares them to all embeddings in db/embeddings.json with cosine similarity - note that the data is encoded in 
base64. The top 10 results are shown.
The OpenAI API key is stored in the local storage of the browser with key `openai_api_key`, or asked from the user 
with `prompt` if not found.

Example request for OpenAI embeddings API:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Your text string goes here",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-large",
    "encoding_format": "base64"
  }' > embed.txt
```

gives

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "index": 0,
      "embedding": "KnupO...G7yr1i28"
    }
  ],
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 5,
    "total_tokens": 5
  }
}
```
