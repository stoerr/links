# My Link Database

This project is meant to be my personal searchable link database, where I can save any number of interesting links
with categorization and a little description. A bit like [things I've learned](https://til.stoerr.net/), but the
here descriptions etc. are mostly generated by AI. Compare the [implementation](Implementation.md).

<input type="textarea" id="search" placeholder="Search keywords...">
<button class="btn" id="searchButton">Search</button>

# Search result

<div id="links"></div>

<script src="assets/js/searchimpl.js"></script>
