# Semgrep: AutoFixes using LLMs

https://choly.ca/post/semgrep-autofix-llm/

## Description

Explore how Semgrep can be used for AutoFixes with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Summary

Semgrep is a powerful tool for searching code using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), allowing users to define patterns to match against code. Not only does Semgrep search using patterns, but it also supports rewriting matches with the built-in autofix feature, making it a comprehensive tool for code analysis and correction.

The article delves into the concept of fixing Semgrep matches using a Large Language Model (LLM), where each match is fed into the LLM and replaced with the response. The author introduces "semgrepx," a tool that serves as "xargs for Semgrep," to facilitate rewriting matches using LLMs. By utilizing this approach, the author provides insights on improving the task by matching a larger expression than necessary and leveraging the LLM's features effectively.

The author also shares practical examples and notes on utilizing the autofix feature in Semgrep and experimenting with different Large Language Models for better performance in code corrections, such as Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus model. Overall, the article offers a unique perspective on combining Semgrep with LLMs for efficient auto-fixing in code analysis and refactoring processes.
