## Summary

In this newsletter, Simon Willison discusses building a tool called files-to-prompt using Claude 3 Opus. This tool allows piping several files at once into prompts for use with LLMs like Claude and GPT-4. Starting with a Click app cookiecutter template, Simon builds and refines the functionality of the tool, delegating code writing tasks to the Claude 3 Opus model. The newsletter also covers enhancements made to the tool, involving additional features and automated testing with LLMs. Additionally, there is a discussion on using ChatGPT Plus for similar automation tasks in file processing workflows.
