## Description

AEM provides tools and resources for creating workflow models, developing workflow steps, and programmatically interacting with workflows.

## Summary

Adobe Experience Manager offers a range of tools and resources for creating, developing, and interacting with workflows. Workflows in AEM automate processes for managing resources and content publishing by breaking tasks into discrete steps. The runtime model of a workflow is crucial for capturing the state of a workflow instance, different types of workflow steps exist for varied functions, and Workflow Stages help visualize the progress of a workflow when handling tasks. Additionally, workflows can be associated with forms for processing form submissions and play a role in the translation process within AEM.
