## Description

The world of Copilot is getting bigger, improving the developer experience by keeping developers in the flow longer and allowing them to do more in natural language.

## Summary

GitHub is introducing GitHub Copilot Extensions to bring the world’s knowledge into the most widely adopted AI developer tool. Through a growing partner ecosystem, Copilot Extensions enables developers to build and deploy to the cloud in their natural language with their preferred tools and services. With this new feature, developers can stay in the flow longer, uplevel their skills, and innovate faster. The initial partners for GitHub Copilot Extensions include DataStax, Docker, LaunchDarkly, Microsoft Azure, and more, making it easier for developers to access a variety of tools and services seamlessly within their workflow.

Copilot Extensions aim to streamline the development process by integrating various tools directly into GitHub Copilot Chat, allowing developers to access documentation, monitor errors, interact with databases, deploy applications, and more—all within one interface. This integration is designed to minimize context-switching, maintain flow state, and accelerate software delivery. As this feature expands, developers will have access to even more tools and services from a growing number of partners to enhance their productivity and efficiency.
