## Description

Insights and lessons learned from a year of building real-world applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Summary

It's an exciting time to build with large language models (LLMs), as they have become “good enough” for real-world applications. The pace of improvements in LLMs is driving significant investment in AI. This article shares crucial lessons and methodologies for developing products based on LLMs. The content is organized into three sections: tactical, operational, and strategic, with this being the first part focusing on the tactical aspects. Key topics covered include prompting, structured inputs and outputs, information retrieval strategies, guarding against hallucinations, and simplifying annotation tasks for LLMs.
