# Transformer Explainer

[https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/)

## Description

A comprehensive interactive tool to explore the inner workings of Transformer models in neural networks.

## Summary

The Transformer Explainer provides users with an interactive interface to understand Transformer architectures in deep learning. It explains the fundamental components of Transformers, including embedding, the Transformer block, the self-attention mechanism, and the roles played by various layers such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and output probabilities for token prediction. The platform leverages the GPT-2 (small) model to facilitate exploration of how input sequences are processed and how the model predicts subsequent tokens.

Through its visualization tools, users can manipulate input text, adjust the temperature parameter to evaluate the randomness or determinism of predictions, and investigate attention maps to see how the model focuses on different tokens within the input. Several advanced architectural features, such as Layer Normalization, Dropout, and Residual Connections, are mentioned as enhancements to the model, providing the user with insights into the complexities of the design and training of Transformer models.
