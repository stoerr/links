# Bayes Rule in Odds Form

[https://two-wrongs.com/bayes-rule-odds-form](https://two-wrongs.com/bayes-rule-odds-form)

## Description

This webpage explains Bayes' rule in its odds form, providing examples and insights into Bayesian hypothesis testing.

## Summary

The article discusses the application of Bayes' rule in its odds form, which simplifies calculations for quick decision-making. It presents the mathematical foundation and how to convert prior odds into posterior odds using the odds ratio derived from evidence. A classic example involving a taxi cab identification problem illustrates the concept, demonstrating how eyewitness testimony can shift the odds regarding which company was at fault in a hit and run.

Further, it provides another illustration using urns with different distributions of colored balls, helping to understand how evidence affects beliefs about competing hypotheses. The piece also touches upon combining multiple independent observations to strengthen the evidence and emphasizes the nature of evidence as a cumulative product of individual observations. Additionally, it includes a derivation of Bayes' rule and underscores the importance of being able to estimate prior odds, especially in the context of low-probability events.

(Odds express the likelihood of an event occurring relative to the likelihood of it not occurring. )
