## Description

Get an introduction to reusing content with AEM's powerful Live Copies and the Multi Site Manager features.

## Summary

The Multi Site Manager (MSM) in Adobe Experience Manager allows users to reuse the same site content in multiple locations using Live Copies. With MSM, content can be created once and reused in various areas of the same or different sites, maintaining live relationships between source content and its Live Copies for synchronization. The documentation provides an overview of reusing content with MSM, covering topics like creating and synchronizing Live Copies, Live Copy overview console, configuring Live Copy synchronization, MSM rollout conflicts, and best practices. MSM functionality can also be used for Assets and Content Fragments. Scenarios for using MSM include multinational applications, national offices to regional branches, and creating multiple versions of a specific sub-branch. Live Copies in MSM can be structured as shallow or deep, and can be composed of non-Live Copy pages or nested Live Copies, with options to detach Live Copies and suspend or cancel inheritance and synchronization. The documentation also includes standard steps for using MSM and customizing rollout configurations, as well as best practices for implementation.
