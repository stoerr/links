## Description

Exploring possible use cases of Phi-3-Vision, a small yet powerful MLLM that can be run locally with code examples.

## Summary

Microsoft recently released Phi-3, a powerful language model called Phi-3-Vision-128k-instruct. This 4B parameter model has achieved impressive results on public benchmarks. It can be utilized in various real-world scenarios such as Optical Character Recognition, Image Captioning, Table Parsing, Figure Understanding, Reading Comprehension on Scanned Documents, and Set-of-Mark Prompting. The post provides code examples to run the model locally and showcases examples for each of these use cases. It discusses the model's efficiency due to its compact size and its applications in tasks like document parsing, table structure understanding, and OCR.
