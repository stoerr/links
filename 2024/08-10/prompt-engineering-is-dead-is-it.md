## Description

Will better, personalized models, agentic setups, programmed prompts make prompt engineering obsolete? How will prompt engineering change and evolve?

## Summary

The article by Maximilian Vogel discusses the evolving nature of prompt engineering in the wake of advancements in artificial intelligence. It addresses the notion that prompt engineering may soon be deemed obsolete due to enhanced models that can understand and interpret user needs more effectively. The article analyzes various arguments surrounding this topic, pointing out that while crafting precise prompts may be less critical as AI advances, understanding problem formulation remains essential. 

Vogel highlights that prompt engineering plays a crucial role in structuring model responses, especially when handling complex applications. He argues that as AI systems become more personalized, they will better understand user context and requirements, potentially reducing the need for detailed prompt crafting but emphasizing the continued importance of clear specifications. 

In conclusion, Vogel believes that prompt engineering will not die but will transform, requiring a deeper understanding and adaptation as both the capabilities of AI and the demands of tasks evolve. The future promises a more nuanced approach to prompt engineering, blending traditional skills with programming and automated systems.
