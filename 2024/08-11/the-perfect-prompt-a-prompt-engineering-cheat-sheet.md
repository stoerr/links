# The Perfect Prompt - A Prompt Engineering Cheat Sheet

[https://medium.com/the-generator/the-perfect-prompt-prompt-engineering-cheat-sheet-d0b9c62a2bba](https://medium.com/the-generator/the-perfect-prompt-prompt-engineering-cheat-sheet-d0b9c62a2bba)

## Description

This article explores effective prompt engineering techniques for large language models to enhance their response quality and relevance.

## Summary

The article elaborates on the significance of crafting precise prompts when interacting with large language models (LLMs). It introduces the AUTOMAT and CO-STAR frameworks as essential guidelines for constructing impactful prompts that clarify context, target actions, and define output formats. Each element of these frameworks is designed to ensure the output aligns with user expectations and to improve the model's reliability in task performance.

Moreover, the piece discusses various strategies, including few-shot learning, chaining thoughts, and output formatting, that can significantly enhance interaction results. Techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are highlighted for their ability to access up-to-date data, bending the limitations imposed by static training data. The cheat sheet serves as a compact resource, aiming to refine the skill of prompt engineering and maximize the potential of AI applications in various contexts.
