## Description

DSPy is a framework for algorithmically optimizing language model prompts and weights, with features that enable systematic programming rather than manual prompting.

## Summary

DSPy provides a systematic approach to using language models (LMs) for building complex systems by abstracting away tedious prompt engineering. It allows developers to separate the flow of their program from LM parameters, and introduces new optimizers that can automatically tune prompts and weights based on desired metrics. This approach aims to enhance reliability and reduce the need for intricate prompt tuning through a more declarative programming model.

The framework can be installed easily via pip and works well with various language models like OpenAI's GPT and local models such as T5 and Llama. By defining tasks and using built-in modules, developers can create efficient workflows that utilize LMs effectively while minimizing the need for traditional prompt engineering methods. The documentation includes tutorials, guides, and examples to help users get started and integrate DSPy into their projects.
