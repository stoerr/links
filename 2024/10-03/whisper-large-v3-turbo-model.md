## Description

OpenAI has introduced a new speech-to-text model called Whisper Turbo, which is designed to be smaller, faster, and maintain high quality.

## Summary

The Whisper large-v3-turbo model, unveiled in conjunction with OpenAI's DevDay, represents the latest advancement in the Whisper series of models. Built to enhance speech-to-text capabilities, this new model boasts 809 million parameters, making it slightly larger than the previous medium model while significantly smaller than the largest variant. OpenAI claims that Whisper Turbo is eight times faster than the larger models and operates with reduced resource requirements, supporting efficiency in processing.

The model is open-source and available under the MIT license, easily accessible through platforms like Hugging Face. Notably, it is compatible with Apple Silicon, demonstrating impressive performance by transcribing lengthy audio segments in a fraction of real-time, making it a robust tool for developers and researchers in the field of speech recognition.
