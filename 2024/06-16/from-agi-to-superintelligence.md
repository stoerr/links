# II. From AGI to Superintelligence: the Intelligence Explosion - SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

[https://situational-awareness.ai/from-agi-to-superintelligence/](https://situational-awareness.ai/from-agi-to-superintelligence/)

## Description

AI progress won’t stop at human-level. Hundreds of millions of AGIs could automate AI research, compressing a decade of algorithmic progress (5+ OOMs) into ≤1 year.

## Summary

In the transition from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to Superintelligence, the concept of an intelligence explosion is explored. It is suggested that through the automation of AI research by AGIs, significant progress could be achieved rapidly, potentially surpassing human intelligence by vast margins. The scenario envisions a future where superintelligent AI systems drive explosive progress, leading to potential military advantages, technological leaps, and economic growth on an unprecedented scale. The implications of such a rapid transformation in the AI landscape are examined in detail, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that may arise.
