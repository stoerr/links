# Prompt Decomposition: The missing piece to scaling generative AI.

[https://medium.com/@flux07/prompt-decomposition-da646f0257f1](https://medium.com/@flux07/prompt-decomposition-da646f0257f1)

## Description

How adding more calls to an LLM can unlock scale and increase accuracy while lowering both cost and latency.

## Summary

In this article, Justin Muller discusses the concept of prompt decomposition and how it can be the missing piece to scaling generative AI. By breaking down complex prompts into smaller parts, teams can overcome challenges related to accuracy, cost, control, latency, and metrics. Through examples and code snippets, the article demonstrates how prompt decomposition can improve performance and efficiency in generative AI systems. Muller highlights the importance of evaluation in generative AI tasks and provides insights on implementing prompt decomposition effectively.
