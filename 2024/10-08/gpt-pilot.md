## Summary

GPT Pilot is an open-source project aimed at utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assist developers in creating fully functioning, production-ready applications, with the developer overseeing the process. The concept emphasizes that while AI can generate a significant portion of the code, developer supervision is essential to ensure the successful completion and debugging of applications.

The repository provides comprehensive instructions for setup, including requirements such as Python and optional PostgreSQL, as well as detailed steps for both initial installation and upgrading from previous versions. It also outlines how GPT Pilot operates, utilizing various agents to take on different roles in the app development process, such as specification gathering, task management, coding, and debugging.

Moreover, the project encourages community involvement and contributions, offering guidance on how individuals can participate in its development. Users are directed to resources to enhance their understanding and engagement with the project, promoting a collaborative development environment.
