## Description

Functionary is a language model that interprets and executes functions and plugins efficiently.

## Summary

Functionary is a powerful language model designed to intelligently handle function calls and interactions through a structured approach. It can execute functions either in parallel or serially while also analyzing their outputs to provide relevant and contextually grounded responses. The model supports OpenAI-compatible server operations and employs advanced sampling techniques for accuracy in predicting function names and arguments.

The implementation features include GPU support for high-performance computing and compatibility with OpenAI's tools and libraries. Users can choose from various models depending on their compute requirements, including options for small, medium, and advanced capabilities that rely on the vLLM server architecture. Additionally, it offers a clear installation guide and usage instructions, along with performance metrics comparing its function call prediction accuracy against OpenAI's models. 

Overall, Functionary presents a robust solution for integrating language models into functional applications, providing the ability to leverage API interactions while ensuring precise execution.
