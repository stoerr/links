# GitHub - igrek51/wat: Deep inspection of Python objects

[https://github.com/igrek51/wat](https://github.com/igrek51/wat)

## Description

Deep inspection of Python objects.

## Summary

The repository provides a tool called "WAT" for deep inspection and examination of Python objects at runtime. It allows users to explore unknown objects in a simplified manner and provides various methods to adjust the output while inspecting objects, such as filtering information or revealing source code. Additionally, users can quickly deploy the inspector without installing it by running a specific snippet in their Python interpreter.

The project supports multiple usage examples and methods to discover types and attributes of objects, making it particularly useful for debugging and understanding Python internals. WAT not only identifies data types and structures but also allows users to see methods, signatures, and extensive documentation, providing valuable insights into their code and libraries they work with.
