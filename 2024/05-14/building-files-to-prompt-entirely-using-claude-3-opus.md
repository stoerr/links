# Building files-to-prompt entirely using Claude 3 Opus

https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/

## Description

Simon Willison shares his experience of building the files-to-prompt tool using Claude 3 Opus to automate the development process.

## Summary

Simon Willison used a combination of files-to-prompt and LLM command-line tools to efficiently build and test the software. By leveraging Claude 3 Opus, he accelerated the development process and added features like .gitignore support. The tool's low stakes nature made it ideal for experimenting with this alternative development approach. Willison highlights the benefits and challenges of using LLMs for code generation and shares his successful experience in upgrading other projects using the same pattern.
