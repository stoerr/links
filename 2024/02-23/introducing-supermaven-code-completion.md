## Description

The fastest copilot. Supermaven uses a 300,000-token context window to provide the highest quality code completions.

## Summary

Supermaven is a code completion tool that differentiates itself by offering a 300,000-token context window for more accurate suggestions. It addresses the limitations of other tools like Copilot by efficiently integrating information across a long context window, resulting in better completions even for complex and unique codebases.

The tool is designed to be fast and responsive, with custom infrastructure to handle large codebases while maintaining low latency. Supermaven also stands out by focusing on sequences of edits rather than just files, allowing it to quickly understand and assist with code refactoring tasks. Users can try Supermaven for themselves and provide feedback on its performance.

Overall, Supermaven aims to provide a competitive alternative in the AI-powered code completion space, offering a unique approach to handling large context windows and delivering accurate suggestions based on user edits and repositories.
