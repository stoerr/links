# Design Patterns for Compound AI Systems (Conversational AI, CoPilots & RAG)

https://medium.com/@raunak-jain/design-patterns-for-compound-ai-systems-copilot-rag-fa911c7a62e0

## Description

How to build configurable flows and compound AI systems using open source tools.

## Summary

Researchers at Berkeley discussed the shift towards Compound AI Systems, highlighting the evolution of complex pipelines and the importance of components working together. Common deployment patterns like RAG (retrieval and understanding is key), Multi-Agent Problem Solvers, Conversational AI, and CoPilots were explored. Compound AI systems are interconnected modules relying on each other to execute design patterns effectively.

Multi-Agent designs offer benefits like separation of concerns, modularity, diversity, and reusability. The GPT Pilot project showcased layered communication among agents with complex prompt engineering techniques. The fine-tuning of agents is crucial for cost reduction and improved accuracy in CoPilot systems.
