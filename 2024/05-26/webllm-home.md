## Description

High-Performance In-Browser LLM Serving Engine.

## Summary

WebLLM is a project aimed at bringing diversity to the ecosystem of generative AI and LLMs by enabling the direct running of language models inside a browser. By doing so, the project offers cost reduction, personalization, and privacy protection benefits for client personal AI models. Users can select a model, enter inputs, and run it directly in the browser. The project leverages WebGPU technology and provides instructions for running different models efficiently. It also emphasizes the research purposes of the demo site and compliance with model licenses.
