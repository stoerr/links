## Description

State-of-the-art Machine Learning for the web. Run ðŸ¤— Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server!

## Summary

Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face's transformers python library, allowing users to run pretrained models in the browser. The library supports common tasks in text processing, computer vision, audio, and multimodal applications. It uses ONNX Runtime to run models in the browser, offering the ability to convert pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX format. The README provides guidance on installation, usage, examples, and contributions to the project.
