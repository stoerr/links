    "text": "# The Art of Coding: A Cruel Optimism?\n\nhttps://medium.com/electronic-life/the-art-of-coding-a-cruel-optimism-59fc52571e91\n\n## Description\n\nAn exploration into the potential and pitfalls of leveraging AI in the art of coding, particularly as a learning tool.\n\n## Summary\n\n\"The Art of Coding: A Cruel Optimism?\" by Sunil Manghani narrates the creation and use of a custom GPT called *The Art of Coding*, designed as an AI assistant to teach coding. This tool targets individuals such as art professors interested in coding by offering explanations, feedback, and the ability to improve their Python programming skills. By leveraging the wealth of coding examples available, the AI demonstrates a natural proficiency in teaching coding, potentially revolutionizing software development by making it more accessible. The essay further discusses the broader implications of AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot and CodiumAI's AlphaCodium, pondering whether the ease and automation brought by such tools could undermine the quality and originality of coding.\n\nManghani draws on historical parallels such as Walter Benjamin's reflections on how photography changed art's nature and accessibility. Similarly, AI in coding could democratize the ability to program software, encouraging creativity and innovation outside traditional confines. However, the author also articulates concerns regarding 'cruel optimism,' a term by Lauren Berlant, highlighting the paradox where the pursuit of efficient coding through AI might hinder deep learning and understanding, leading to over-reliance and potential skill atrophy among programmers. The piece concludes by questioning if the initiative to make coding more accessible through AI assists in expanding creativity or if it inadvertently entrenches a dependency that could stifle the inherent artfulness and human insight in programming.\n\n// same thing as JSON:\n{\n    \"filename\": \"TheArtOfCodingACruelOptimism\",\n    \"category\": \"AI, Coding, Education, Artificial Intelligence, Code Generation\",\n    \"url\": \"https://medium.com/electronic-life/the-art-of-coding-a-cruel-optimism-59fc52571e91\"\n    \"title\": \"The Art of Coding: A Cruel Optimism?\"\n    \"description\": \"An exploration into the potential and pitfalls of leveraging AI in the art of coding, particularly as a learning tool.\"\n    \"summary\": \"The Art of Coding: A Cruel Optimism? by Sunil Manghani narrates the creation and use of a custom GPT called The Art of Coding, designed as an AI assistant to teach coding.
